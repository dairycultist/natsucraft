# NatsuCraft (working title)

A soft-fantasy mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI.

My goal for this mod is to cut down on the survival aspect of beta Minecraft, and flesh out the exploration aspect (which I find more fun).

## Implemented (subject to change)

### Vanilla+

- Decoration Blocks
  - Glowcaps (mushroom that glows when placed)
  - Jungle wood
  - Ornate sandstone (lapis and glowsap)
- Exploration
  - Updated rainforest biome (previously was just a forest that spawned big oak trees more often)
  - Updated forest biome (inspired by The Aether/Deep Aether)
    - Grows mushrooms (including glowcaps)
    - Some tree logs are glowsap ore
  - Updated desert biome
    - Desert shrine (dungeon?)
- Mob skin variants (I like the Deep Aether's pastel quails)
  - Chickens (also they have tails now)
- Idle regen
- Spiders are no longer slowed by cobwebs
- Weapon/tool rework
  - Remove tool durability
  - Remove crafting recipes of wooden and stone weapons/tools
  - Player spawns with stone tools (on world spawn and after death)
  - Retexture/rename stone tools to copper

### New enemies

- Lich ([inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)) ([skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e))
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich (?)
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword

### Unique tools/weapons/armor
- Lich sword (dropped by Lich)

## To-do

- Add custom jungle leaves + sapling
- Refactor to dairycultist.\<new title>
- Lots of unique tools/weapons/armor
  - Ceremonial Dagger - low damage, but vampirism (found as loot) 
  - Pharaoh's Blade - high damage (found as loot)
  - Scimitar - basically just an iron sword (dropped by mummies)

## Planned (maybe)

- Update some UI textures (like hearts and inventory)
- Decoration Blocks
  - Mossy cobblestone for structures probably
- Exploration (my fav)
  - Surface Structures
    - Villages
  - Dungeons
    - I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
    - Has iron, gold, and sometimes an unlit nether portal, meaning you technically don't need to do any mining to progress
  - Updated forest biome
    - grows blackberry bushes (and blueberries, and bunnies, and quails, like the Aether)
    - spawns slimes
  - Nether
    - Grows mushrooms (including glowcaps)
    - Gold (and diamond) are only found most often (but not exclusively) in the nether
      - you need gold to make another portal
      - if you don't like mining for endgame gear, you can explore/fight for it instead
    - Red slime
- Armor rework
  - Armor now grants more max HP instead of reducing damage taken
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
