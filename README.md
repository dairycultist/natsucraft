>[!NOTE]
>Beta Minecraft is very nice because of its simplicity, but it doesn't really have a lot of content, so you can't play it for very long. I want to add more content that leans into light-fantasy survival, without making it bloated like I feel modern Minecraft is. I'm not gonna make changes to the base-game loop/feel.

# My mod

What do I like about Minecraft? Maybe I should actually play it to find out lol

### Implemented

subject to change (I should remove sapphire)

- Lich
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
  - [inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)
  - [skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e)

### Planned (maybe)

- Exploration
  - Dungeons, because I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
  - Jungles (with tall trees, either oak or new yellow jungle wood)
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
