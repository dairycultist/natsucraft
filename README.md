# My mod

A mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI. Working title. Keepin' it soft-fantasy.

### Implemented (subject to change)

- Glowcaps - new type of mushroom that glows when placed
- Exploration
  - Updated rainforest biome (previously was just a forest that spawned big oak trees more often)
    - New wood type
    - Very tall trees
  - Updated forest biome (inspired by The Aether/Deep Aether)
    - Grows mushrooms (including glowcaps)
- Lich
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
  - [inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)
  - [skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e)
- Mob skin variants (I like the Deep Aether's pastel quails)
  - Chickens (also they have tails now)

### To-do

- Add custom rainforest leaves + sapling
- Add automatic regen
- Remove tool durability
- Retexture stone tools to copper, remove their crafting recipe, and make the player spawn with them by default (even after death!)

### Planned (maybe)

- Update some UI textures (like hearts and inventory)
- Decoration Blocks
  - Mossy cobblestone for structures probably
- Exploration (my fav)
  - Surface Structures
  - Dungeons
    - I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
    - Has iron, gold, and sometimes an unlit nether portal, meaning you technically don't need to do any mining to progress
  - Updated forest biome
    - grows blackberry bushes (and blueberries, and bunnies, and quails, like the Aether)
    - spawns slimes
  - Nether
    - Grows mushrooms (including glowcaps)
    - Gold (and diamond) are only found most often (but not exclusively) in the nether
      - you need gold to make another portal
      - if you don't like mining for endgame gear, you can explore/fight for it instead
    - Red slime
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
