# Megaliths Minecraft Mod

I'm gonna cut down the scope of this project to just megalophobia-inducing above-ground dungeons (megaliths).

I just wanna come across a strange cobblestone monument in Minecraft beta and explore/loot its kilometers of hallways :3

The thing with Minecraft structures is they're so drop-in-a-bucket, they should be incorporated into the surroundings more.
Like how biomes aren't just 1 chunk of biome, structures should be more spread out, with peripheral structures and bigger
central structures incorporated into the terrain. Ancient ruins that build on the lonely feeling in b1.7.3.
Stone structures that could possibly date back to some kind of really old lost civilization.

## Implemented

I already tested it, and all these things work 100% serverside.

- MegalithFeature
  - `/place` command to place a MegalithFeature
  - Spawn naturally in the world
- Spiders are no longer slowed by cobwebs

## TO-DO

- Tune spawnrate of megaliths
- Decide on size of megaliths
- Add chests to megaliths
- Add arches to megaliths
- Add new rooms to megaliths (for more variety to be worth exploring)
