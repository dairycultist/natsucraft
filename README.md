# NatsuCraft (working title)

A soft-fantasy mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI.

My goal for this mod is to cut down on the survival aspect of beta Minecraft, and flesh out the exploration aspect (which I find more fun).

### Implemented (subject to change)

- Decoration Blocks
  - Glowcaps (mushroom that glows when placed)
  - Jungle wood
- Exploration
  - Updated rainforest biome (previously was just a forest that spawned big oak trees more often)
  - Updated forest biome (inspired by The Aether/Deep Aether)
    - Grows mushrooms (including glowcaps)
- Lich ([inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)) ([skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e))
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich (?)
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
- Mob skin variants (I like the Deep Aether's pastel quails)
  - Chickens (also they have tails now)
- Idle regen

### To-do

- Add custom rainforest leaves + sapling
- Remove tool durability
- Retexture stone tools to copper, remove their crafting recipe, and make the player spawn with them by default (even after death!)
- Add fairies
  - look like white/gold 2x2x2 cubes that fly
  - you can pick them up and release them again (somehow)
  - a white one plus 8 gold can craft into a golden one
  - you can craft a fairy nest from a log and some flowers which spawns ("attracts") fairies. fairy garden!
  - Used for crafting
    - golden fairy + apple = golden apple
- Refactor to dairycultist.<new title>

### Planned (maybe)

- Update some UI textures (like hearts and inventory)
- Decoration Blocks
  - Mossy cobblestone for structures probably
- Exploration (my fav)
  - Surface Structures
    - Villages
  - Dungeons
    - I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
    - Has iron, gold, and sometimes an unlit nether portal, meaning you technically don't need to do any mining to progress
  - Updated forest biome
    - grows blackberry bushes (and blueberries, and bunnies, and quails, like the Aether)
    - spawns slimes
  - Nether
    - Grows mushrooms (including glowcaps)
    - Gold (and diamond) are only found most often (but not exclusively) in the nether
      - you need gold to make another portal
      - if you don't like mining for endgame gear, you can explore/fight for it instead
    - Red slime
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
