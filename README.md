>[!NOTE]
>A mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI. Beta Minecraft is very nice because of its simplicity, but it doesn't really have a lot of content, so you can't play it for very long. I want to add more content that leans into **soft-fantasy casual survival**, without making it bloated like I feel modern Minecraft is. I'm not gonna make changes to the base-game loop/feel.

# My mod

### Implemented

subject to change (I should remove sapphire)

- Lich
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
  - [inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)
  - [skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e)

### Planned (maybe)

- Exploration
  - Dungeons, because I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
  - Jungles (with tall trees, either oak or new yellow jungle wood)
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
- Revive mechanic (to prevent frustration): When you are slain, you are sent to a dimension with a pool of water decorated with stone and vegetation. A angel's statue heads the pool which, when clicked, tells you to "empty your entire inventory except for your hotbar into the pool." Upon your complying, you are sent back to the place you were slain.
