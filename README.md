# NatsuCraft (working title)

A soft-fantasy mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI.

## Implemented (subject to change)

[//]: # (My goal for this mod is to cut down on the survival aspect of beta Minecraft, and flesh out the exploration aspect &#40;which I find more fun&#41;.)
[//]: # (I like customization)
[//]: # (I like RPG mechanics)
[//]: # (I like dungeons)
[//]: # (I like resource gathering)
[//]: # (Add a character development system into minecraft)
[//]: # (with skills and stuff)
[//]: # (honestly I should really just keep things simple)
[//]: # (I go so overboard adding stuff that's not really overtly fun)
[//]: # (I should just... add a bunch of dungeons and biomes)
[//]: # (I just wanna come across a strange cobblestone monument in Minecraft beta and explore its hallways :<)

### Misc

- Idle regen
- Ornate sandstone (lapis and glowstone)

### Dungeons

- Desert crypt
- Deep dungeon

### Biomes

- Updated rainforest biome (previously was just a forest that spawned big oak trees more often, now has jungle trees with jungle wood!)
- Updated forest biome (inspired by The Aether/Deep Aether)
  - Grows mushrooms, including new glowcaps
- Updated Nether
  - Grows glowcaps

### Mobs

- Add Lich ([inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)) ([skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e))
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich (?)
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
- Add Mummy ([skin base](https://www.minecraftskins.com/skin/22900078/mummy/))
  - Drops fabric
  - Basically just a retextured zombie that doesn't burn in daylight
- Chicken
  - skin variants (I like the Deep Aether's pastel quails)
  - they have tails now
- Spiders are no longer slowed by cobwebs

## To-do

- Add custom jungle leaves + sapling
- Refactor to dairycultist.\<new title>
- Some sort of mechanic that encourages both 1) building a permanent, large base and 2) often leaving base to explore far away before returning

- make deep dungeons have random contents/variants. some are zombie, some are spider, etc, but the top is the same,
- spider boss, twice the size of a regular spider, with a big butt, make the texture kind of white. spawns at the bottom of a special spider dungeons

## Ideas that may or may not be added

- Update some UI textures (like hearts and inventory)
- you should implement a key that you find in the dungeon to unlock the boss door
- Exploration (my fav)
  - Surface Structures
    - Villages
    - Battle towers
  - Dungeons
    - I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
    - Has iron, gold, and sometimes an unlit nether portal, meaning you technically don't need to do any mining to progress
  - Updated forest biome
    - grows blackberry bushes (and blueberries, and bunnies, and quails, like the Aether)
    - spawns slimes
  - Nether
    - Gold (and diamond) are only found most often (but not exclusively) in the nether
      - you need gold to make another portal
      - if you don't like mining for endgame gear, you can explore/fight for it instead
    - Red slime
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
  - Port over cockatrice for their feathers? could probably also use their features for some new weapons/tools
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
