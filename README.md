# NatsuCraft (working title)

A soft-fantasy mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI.

My goal for this mod is to cut down on the survival aspect of beta Minecraft, and flesh out the exploration aspect (which I find more fun).

## Implemented (subject to change)

I like customization
I like RPG mechanics
I like dungeons
I like resource gathering
Add a character development system into minecraft
with skills and stuff
honestly I should really just keep things simple
I go so overboard adding stuff that's not really overtly fun
I should just... add a bunch of dungeons and biomes

- Idle regen

### Dungeons

### Biomes

- Updated rainforest biome (previously was just a forest that spawned big oak trees more often, now has jungle trees with jungle wood!)
- Updated forest biome (inspired by The Aether/Deep Aether)
  - Grows mushrooms, including new glowcaps
- Updated desert biome
  - Desert shrine (featuring an underground dungeon)
  - Ornate sandstone (lapis and glowstone)

### Mobs

- Add Lich ([inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)) ([skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e))
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich (?)
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
- Add Mummy ([skin base](https://www.minecraftskins.com/skin/22900078/mummy/))
  - Drops fabric
  - Basically just a retextured zombie that doesn't burn in daylight
- Chicken
  - skin variants (I like the Deep Aether's pastel quails)
  - they have tails now
- Spiders are no longer slowed by cobwebs

## To-do

- Add custom jungle leaves + sapling
- Refactor to dairycultist.\<new title>
- Some sort of mechanic that encourages both 1) building a permanent, large base and 2) often leaving base to explore far away before returning

## Ideas that may or may not be added

- Lots of unique tools/weapons/armor
  - Ceremonial Dagger - low damage, but vampirism (found as loot)
  - Pharaoh's Blade - high damage (found as loot)
  - Scimitar - basically just an iron sword (dropped by mummies)
- Update some UI textures (like hearts and inventory)
- Exploration (my fav)
  - Surface Structures
    - Villages
    - Battle towers
  - Dungeons
    - I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
    - Has iron, gold, and sometimes an unlit nether portal, meaning you technically don't need to do any mining to progress
  - Updated forest biome
    - grows blackberry bushes (and blueberries, and bunnies, and quails, like the Aether)
    - spawns slimes
  - Nether
    - Grows mushrooms (including glowcaps)
    - Gold (and diamond) are only found most often (but not exclusively) in the nether
      - you need gold to make another portal
      - if you don't like mining for endgame gear, you can explore/fight for it instead
    - Red slime
- Armor rework
  - Armor now grants more max HP instead of reducing damage taken
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
  - Port over cockatrice for their feathers? could probably also use their features for some new weapons/tools
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
