# Dungeoncraft

A soft-fantasy mod for b1.7.3 that adds cool dungeons.

I'm gonna cut down the scope of this project to just dungeons and dungeon-related stuff (mobs, blocks, etc).

I just wanna come across a strange cobblestone monument in Minecraft beta and explore/loot its hallways :<

## Implemented (subject to change)

### Misc

- Idle regen
- Ornate sandstone (lapis and glowstone)

### Dungeons

- Desert crypt
- Deep dungeon

### Biomes

- Updated rainforest biome (previously was just a forest that spawned big oak trees more often, now has jungle trees with jungle wood!)
- Updated forest biome (inspired by The Aether/Deep Aether)
  - Grows mushrooms, including new glowcaps
- Updated Nether
  - Grows glowcaps

### Mobs

- Add Lich ([inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)) ([skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e))
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich (?)
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
- Add Mummy ([skin base](https://www.minecraftskins.com/skin/22900078/mummy/))
  - Drops fabric
  - Basically just a retextured zombie that doesn't burn in daylight
- Chicken
  - skin variants (I like the Deep Aether's pastel quails)
  - they have tails now
- Spiders are no longer slowed by cobwebs

## To-do

- Refactor to dairycultist.\<new title>
- Some sort of mechanic that encourages both 1) building a permanent, large base and 2) often leaving base to explore far away before returning
