# My mod

A mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI. Working title. For soft-fantasy casual survival.

### Implemented (subject to change)

- Exploration
  - Jungle biome (with tall trees and new wood)
- Lich
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
  - [inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)
  - [skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e)

### Planned (definitely!!)

- Exploration
  - Magical Forest biome (inspired by The Aether/Deep Aether)
    - Grows "somnishrooms" that, when eaten, speed up the daylight cycle until dusk

### Planned (maybe)

- Exploration
  - Dungeons, because I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
- Maybe berries? idk blueberries are cool, and bunnies, and quails, like the Aether
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
- Mob skin variants (I like the Deep Aether's pastel quails)
- Revive mechanic (to prevent frustration): When you are slain, you are sent to a dimension with a pool of water decorated with stone and vegetation. An angel's statue heads the pool which, when clicked, tells you to "Forgo your mortal possessions to the pool and be born again. You may only keep items within your hotbar. Click me when you are ready." Upon your complying, you are sent back to the place you were slain.
