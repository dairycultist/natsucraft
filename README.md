>[!NOTE]
>A mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI. Beta Minecraft is very nice because of its simplicity, but it doesn't really have a lot of content, so you can't play it for very long. I want to add more content that leans into **soft-fantasy casual survival**, without making it bloated like I feel modern Minecraft is. I'm not gonna make changes to the base-game loop/feel.

# My mod

working title

### Implemented (subject to change)

- Exploration
  - Jungles (with tall trees and new wood)
- Lich
  - end goal of the game is to defeat the lich
  - a knight with a skeleton head
  - After a certain amount of damage, the lich uses necromancy to summon three skeletons in a puff of smoke to assist it in battle
  - summoned by...
  - drops the lich sword
  - [inspiration](https://the-grimoire-of-gaia.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Knight)
  - [skin base](https://namemc.com/skin/adcc6eab0088f51e)

### Planned (maybe)

- Exploration
  - Dungeons, because I like dungeon crawling/looting and caving (and I don't like stripmining)
  - Magical Forest biome (inspired by The Aether/Deep Aether)
    - Grows "somnishrooms" that speed up the daylight cycle until dusk
    - Maybe berries? idk blueberries are cool, and bunnies, and quails
- Wings ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-flight))
- Familiars ([reference](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/touhou-little-maid))
- Mob skin variants (I like the Deep Aether's pastel quails)
- Revive mechanic (to prevent frustration): When you are slain, you are sent to a dimension with a pool of water decorated with stone and vegetation. An angel's statue heads the pool which, when clicked, tells you to "Forgo your mortal possessions to the pool and be born again. You may only keep items within your hotbar. Click me when you are ready." Upon your complying, you are sent back to the place you were slain.
